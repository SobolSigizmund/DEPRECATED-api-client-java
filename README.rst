Getting started
---------------

This Java client allows users to call the `Google Genomics API`_ through the
command line.

* To use, first build the client using `Apache Maven`_::

    cd api-client-java
    mvn package

* Then, follow the `sign up instructions`_ to generate a valid
  ``client_secrets.json`` file.

* Move the ``client_secrets.json`` file into the api-client-java directory.
  (Authentication will take place the first time you make an API call.)

* You can then perform API queries like fetching readsets or
  reads::

    java -jar target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar searchreadsets --dataset_id 10473108253681171589 --fields "readsets(id,name)"

    java -jar target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar searchreads --readset_id "CMvnhpKTFhD04eLE-q2yxnU" --sequence_name chr1 --sequence_start 10000 --sequence_end 10000


Troubleshooting
---------------
    
* You can get a list of valid commands by running::

   java -jar target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar

* Or get help on a specific command with::

   java -jar target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar searchreadsets

* If your environment isnâ€™t capable of running a local server, and then
  seeing that server on `localhost` with a browser, then you can use the ``--nolocalserver``
  flag to go back to the more manual auth process::
  
    java -jar target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar listjobs --nolocalserver 

* Note that not all of Google's APIs are callable at this time. The docs have 
  `a list <http://google-genomics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/auth_requirements.html>`_ 
  of which APIs are available.
  
* If you wish to call an API that has not yet been fully integrated into 
  the command line, use the ``custom`` command.

Code layout
-----------

`CommandLine.java <src/main/java/com/google/cloud/genomics/api/client/CommandLine.java>`_:
    sets up the command line options using the `jcommander library
    <https://github.com/cbeust/jcommander>`_.

`GenomicsSample.java <src/main/java/com/google/cloud/genomics/api/client/GenomicsSample.java>`_:
    uses the `GenomicsFactory` from `utils-java <https://github.com/googlegenomics/utils-java>`_
    to set up a valid `Genomics` object. It then dispatches to one of the command classes to 
    handle the user's request.
    
`commands <src/main/java/com/google/cloud/genomics/api/client/commands>`_:
    This directory contains one java file for each command line option, 
    which translates the user's command line arguments into API calls.


Updating the prebuilt jar
-------------------------

The prebuilt jar is currently generated by hand, whenever the code seems 
stable and has enough new features to warrant the effort.

To update the jar, we use a different set of maven commands::

  cd api-client-java
  mvn clean
  mvn assembly:assembly
  cp target/genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta-jar-with-dependencies.jar genomics-tools-client-java-v1beta.jar



Project status
--------------

Goals
~~~~~
* Provide a command line interface to the Google Genomics APIs 
  (to make importing, querying, and other methods more accessible)
* Provide an example of how to use the generated Java client library.


Current status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       
Please file feature requests for additional things the command line can do to make your life easier!


The mailing list
----------------

The `Google Genomics Discuss mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-genomics-discuss>`_ is a good
way to sync up with other people who use genomics-tools including the core developers. You can subscribe
by sending an email to ``google-genomics-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com`` or just post using
the `web forum page <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/google-genomics-discuss>`_.
